### Plots from TidyTuesday Wk 7 (Feb 11)

A quick plot of stacked barchart to understand the trend in R&D expenditure by department/agency in the US. 
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of R&D is in defense, although it is heartening to see rising shares of health research.

_My immediate idea was to plot lines, but it didn't highlight the shares too well. I realized line plots are all I 
ever do, so it was great working on a barchart. 
I learned about how to order factors, came across [this great post by BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/),
and also about reducing the gap between the plot and the axes._

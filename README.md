### Plots from TidyTuesday Wk 7 (Feb 11)

A quick plot of stacked barchart to understand the trend in R&D expenditure by department/agency in the US. 
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of R&D is in defense, although it is heartening to see rising shares of health research.

_My immediate idea was to plot lines, but it didn't highlight the shares too well. I realized line plots are all I 
ever do, so it was great working on a barchart. 
I learned about how to order factors, came across [this great post by BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/),
and also about reducing the gap between the plot and the axes._

### Plots from TidyTuesday Wk 8 (Feb 19)

As a PhD student from the UK, this weeks dataset hit close to home. I wanted to look at the differences in experiences of women vs men, in light of the emerging stories of women in economics. The first plot (a bar plot once again) looks at the difference in the median number of years it takes women to join a PhD after their bachelors' compared to men. Quite pleased at seeing no difference in the social sciences, although the overall academia isn't so neutral (possibly for a number of reasons, but I won't be surprised if some of those are not note-worthy).

The second plot combines two of my interests: the proportion of PhD grads leaving academia and the wish to use gganimate. The interesting point is that the large majority of male PhD grads choose the industry, while female PhD grads choose non-profits or academia. As a _soon-to-be_ female PhD grad, I find myself in the minority - but very pleased with my decision of choosing the industry.

### Plots from TidyTuesday Wk 9 (Feb 26)

I wanted to try a plot that reflects train journeys and thought the arcdiagram package would be perfect. I decided to sum up the average delays at arrival and departure for 2017, and take the average over the whole of 2017 for each departure-arrival station pair. Unfortunately, I could not change the line ends to arrow-heads to show the direction of the arcs. As a result, it is hard to understand from the figure which station has the worst record. If I get time next week, I might update the line shapes so it is clearer.
